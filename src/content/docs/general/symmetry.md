title: Symmetry Network
description: Explore Symmetry, a distributed computing network integrated with the twinny VS Code extension and accessible via an OpenAI-compatible API.
---

Symmetry is a distributed network enabling users to share and access computational resources. Initially part of the twinny VS Code extension, Symmetry is evolving into a versatile tool for developers, researchers, and data scientists, accessible through various means including an OpenAI-compatible API.

The Symmetry client is open-source and licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. You can find the project on GitHub: [twinnydotdev/symmetry](https://github.com/twinnydotdev/symmetry).

## Accessing Symmetry via OpenAI-Compatible API (twinny.dev)

Symmetry is accessible through an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint hosted at `https://twinny.dev`. This allows you to interact with models on the Symmetry network using standard OpenAI client libraries or direct HTTP requests, facilitating integration with existing applications.

**API Base URL**: `https://twinny.dev/v1`

### API Features and Endpoints

-   **Chat Completions**:
    -   **Endpoint**: `/chat/completions` (full path: `https://twinny.dev/v1/chat/completions`)
    -   **Description**: Used for chat-based interactions with models available on the Symmetry network.
    -   **Note**: This API is rate-limited to ensure fair usage. Requests exceeding the limit will receive a `429` status code. It also supports conversation management using an `id` field in your requests.

### Authentication

To use the `https://twinny.dev` API endpoint, you will need an API key. Refer to the [twinny.dev provider settings in twinny](/general/providers/#twinnydev-symmetry-network) for details on obtaining and using an API key.

### Example Request (Chat Completions)

```javascript
// Using fetch API with Node.js (ensure you have a fetch polyfill or use a library like node-fetch)
// In browsers, fetch is natively available.

async function getSymmetryChatCompletion(apiKey, modelName, userMessage) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://twinny.dev/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` // Include your API key
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: modelName, // Specify the model available on Symmetry
        messages: [
          { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant.' },
          { role: 'user', content: userMessage }
        ],
        // stream: true // Responses are typically streamed as Server-Sent Events (SSE)
      })
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`API request failed with status ${response.status}: ${await response.text()}`);
    }

    // Assuming the response is SSE or a JSON object if not streaming
    // For SSE, you'd handle the stream appropriately.
    // For a non-streaming example (if supported):
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data.choices[0].message.content);

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching chat completion:', error);
  }
}

// Example usage:
// getSymmetryChatCompletion('YOUR_API_KEY', 'some-model-on-symmetry', 'Hello, how are you?');
```
**Note on Streaming (SSE)**: The original example mentioned SSE. If the API primarily uses SSE, the client-side handling would involve `EventSource` or similar mechanisms to process the stream of events. The example above shows a basic JSON response handling for simplicity but includes a comment about streaming.

## Becoming a Symmetry Network Provider

Contributing your computational resources to the Symmetry network can be a rewarding way to support the community and make use of idle hardware.

### Why Become a Provider?

-   **Support Decentralized AI**: Contribute to building a distributed and accessible computing network.
-   **Utilize Idle Resources**: Put your spare computational power to good use.
-   **Future Incentives**: Be part of a network with potential for future incentive systems (e.g., token rewards, subject to network evolution).
-   **Gain Experience**: Learn about peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies and distributed systems.
-   **Facilitate Research**: Enable access to diverse computational resources, which can indirectly support research and development in the AI field by providing a larger, more varied set of models and providers.

### How to Set Up a Provider Node

Setting up a Symmetry provider node involves running the Symmetry CLI and configuring it to serve an AI model.

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Node.js v18 or higher must be installed.
    *   An accessible AI model endpoint (e.g., a local Ollama instance).

2.  **Install the Symmetry CLI**:

    **Unix/Linux/macOS**:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://www.twinny.dev/symmetry-unix.sh | sh
    ```

    **Windows (PowerShell)**:
    ```powershell
    iwr -useb https://www.twinny.dev/symmetry-windows.ps1 | iex
    ```

3.  **Configure Your Provider Node**:
    Create a `provider.yaml` file in the Symmetry configuration directory (`~/.config/symmetry/` on Linux/macOS, or `%APPDATA%\symmetry\` on Windows). This file contains your provider settings. See the "Provider Configuration (`provider.yaml`)" section below for details.

4.  **Start Your Node**:
    Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    symmetry-cli
    ```
    The CLI will attempt to initialize using your `provider.yaml`, connect to the Symmetry network, and make a test call to your local model endpoint to verify the setup.

    Example startup log:
    ```
    ‚ÑπÔ∏è INFO: üîó Initializing client using config file: /home/user/.config/symmetry/provider.yaml
    ‚ÑπÔ∏è INFO: üìÅ Symmetry client initialized.

    ```

### Programmatic Setup (using `symmetry-core`)

For developers looking to integrate Symmetry provider capabilities directly into Node.js applications, the `symmetry-core` package is available.

```bash
npm install symmetry-core
```

```javascript
import { SymmetryProvider } from 'symmetry-core'; // Adjust import based on package structure

// Example configuration for the provider
const providerConfig = {
  apiHostname: "localhost", // Host of your local AI model endpoint
  apiKey: "your_model_endpoint_api_key", // API key for your model endpoint (if required)
                                       // This key is for local access, not sent to the Symmetry server.
  apiBasePath: "/v1",         // Base path for your model endpoint (e.g., /v1 for Ollama OpenAI-compatible)
  apiPort: 11434,             // Port for your model endpoint
  apiProtocol: "http",        // Protocol for your model endpoint
  modelName: "ollama/llama3.1:latest", // Model identifier you are serving (e.g., ollama/model:tag)
  name: "MySymmetryNode",      // A public name for your provider node
  serverKey: "4b4a9cc325d134dee6679e9407420023531fd7e96c563f6c5d00fd5549b77435", // Public key of the Symmetry matchmaking server
  systemMessage: "You are a helpful AI assistant served by MySymmetryNode.", // Optional default system message
  userSecret: "a_very_strong_and_unique_secret_for_my_node" // A private, unique secret for your node.
                                                          // Keep this secure. It's used for identification/tracking on the network.
};

// const provider = new SymmetryProvider(providerConfig);
// provider.start(); // Example method to start the provider
```
Ensure you refer to the `symmetry-core` package documentation for the most accurate and detailed usage instructions.

### Provider Setup via twinny VS Code Extension

The twinny VS Code extension also offers a user interface to configure and run your local machine as a Symmetry provider, simplifying the process of sharing your computational resources.

### Provider Configuration (`provider.yaml`)

Here‚Äôs an example of a `provider.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Hostname of your local AI model inference server (e.g., Ollama, LM Studio)
apiHostname: localhost
# API key for your local inference server, if it requires one (leave blank or remove if not needed)
apiKey:
# Base path for the API of your local inference server (e.g., /v1 for Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
apiBasePath: /v1
# Port your local inference server is listening on
apiPort: 11434
# Protocol for your local inference server (http or https)
apiProtocol: http
# Name of the model you are serving, often in provider/model:tag format (e.g., ollama/llama3:8b)
# This should match a model that Symmetry network users can request.
modelName: ollama/llama3:8b
# A public name for your provider node displayed on the network
name: MyAwesomeProvider
# The public key of the Symmetry matchmaking server. This is usually a fixed value for the network.
serverKey: 4b4a9cc325d134dee6679e9407420023531fd7e96c563f6c5d00fd5549b77435
# Optional default system message to prepend to conversations handled by your node
systemMessage: "I'm a helpful assistant, served by MyAwesomeProvider!"
# A unique, private secret for your provider node.
# This is crucial for identification and potential future reward tracking. Keep it secure.
userSecret: "replace_this_with_a_strong_unique_secret"
```
Adjust these settings based on your specific local AI model endpoint and preferences.

## Important Considerations for Providers

-   **Security**: Ensure your node and the underlying AI model server are secure and kept up-to-date.
-   **Data Handling**: Be aware that you are processing data from users. Handle it responsibly and in accordance with any applicable privacy considerations.
