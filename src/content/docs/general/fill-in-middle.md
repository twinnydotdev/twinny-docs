description: Learn how to use twinny for code completion (fill-in-the-middle).
---

twinny offers code completion to help you write code more efficiently. As you type, twinny will automatically suggest completions, similar to GitHub Copilot.

If you prefer to trigger code completion manually:
1. Disable "Automatic Inline Code Completion" in the twinny settings (accessible from the top of the twinny side panel).
2. Use the keyboard shortcut `Alt+\` to request a completion.

**Shortcut Conflicts:**

twinny uses the same default keyboard shortcut (`Alt+\`) for manual code completion as GitHub Copilot. If you have both extensions enabled with this shortcut, it can lead to conflicts. To resolve this, you may need to disable this shortcut in one of the extensions or reconfigure it in your VS Code keyboard shortcut settings (e.g., assign a different shortcut to twinny's "Trigger Completion" command).

For more information on models that support the fill-in-the-middle technique, see the [Supported Models page](/twinny-docs/general/supported-models/).
